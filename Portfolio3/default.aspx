					<h1>Hi, I am Bikramjeet Singh Anand!</h1>
					<p>Hello everybody. I am Bikramjeet Singh Anand,Few areas of my education have stimulated me to think as much as my undergraduate courses in Data Structures, Theory of Computation and Computer Programming have. When I watch videos of Pranav Mistry demonstrating his Sixth Sense technology or when I used Google Wave for the first time or even when I log into Facebook everyday and come up against some new feature, what I feel is a sense of marvel. Here are innovations that keep evolving not only technically but also hold infinite scope for creativity and logic. I feel a similar sense of exhilaration when I see my own code run successfully. It is this feeling, which till date, drives me to not give up on even the toughest of problems.  </p>

				<p>Fuzzy keyword search is needed as it provides tight security against the hackers and the

trapdoors who want the access to the data in order to hack the information. This straightforward

approach apparently provides fuzzy keyword search over the encrypted files while achieving

search privacy using the technique of secure trapdoors. However, this approach has serious

efficiency disadvantages. <a href="pages/MyWork.aspx">View More</a></p>

				<p>Technical feasibility centers on the existing computer system (hardware , software, etc..) and to

what extent it can support the proposed addition. For example, if the current computer is

operating at 80% capacity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="pages/Myservices.aspx">View More</a></p>

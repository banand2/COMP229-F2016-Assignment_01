        About Me

    </h3>
    <p class="centered">
        Hello everybody. I'm I am Bikramjeet Singh Anand,Few areas of my education have stimulated me to think as much as my undergraduate courses in Data Structures, Theory of Computation and Computer Programming have. When I watch videos of Pranav Mistry demonstrating his Sixth Sense technology or when I used Google Wave for the first time or even when I log into Facebook everyday and come up against some new feature, what I feel is a sense of marvel. Here are innovations that keep evolving not only technically but also hold infinite scope for creativity and logic. I feel a similar sense of exhilaration when I see my own code run successfully. It is this feeling, which till date, drives me to not give up on even the toughest of problems.
